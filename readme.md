# Stencil Styling Demo
The purpose of this demonstration is to understand **how StencilJS applies scoped styles to Web Components**.
See the full demo running at https://stencil-styling.webtraining.fun/

* * *

In this demo we are:

* Adding Bootstrap 4.x to demonstrate a whole framework included as "global" styles
* Enabling general/global styles following Stencil's official mechanism (see [`/build/demo-stenciljs-scoped-styles.css`](/build/demo-stenciljs-scoped-styles.css))
* Combining [`shadow: true`](https://stenciljs.com/docs/styling#shadow-dom) with [`scoped: true`](https://stenciljs.com/docs/styling#scoped-css)
* Consuming [an actual REST API](http://conference.webtraining.fun/api/talks/) that serves a set of items (just showing one item for simplicity)
* Using TypeScript for writing both Stencil components based on classes and [functional components](https://stenciljs.com/docs/functional-components)
* Using utilities to format dates based on [DayJS](https://day.js.org/en/)
* Including [Font Awesome 4](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) was included to demonstrate that even if global fonts are available with the Shadow DOM enabled, the styles for CSS classes `fa fa-microphone` aren't (a solution to this could be to create a web component that embeds the styles).

## Stencil

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.  Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Getting Started

To start building this project in your local environment, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alex-arriaga/demo-stenciljs-scoped-styles.git
cd demo-stenciljs-scoped-styles
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm test
```
